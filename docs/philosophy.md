# Absolute Zero

This project explores the aesthetics of execution without output.

Inspired by Malbolge's self-modifying silence and the ternary form of musical recursion - A-B-A - the system reflects on autonomy, minimal cognition, and the emotional resonance of doing nothing.

It is a page that runs.
It is a language that says nothing.
It is a machine that hums and leaves no trace.
