A machine that runs, says nothing, and reveals nothing.

This project blends Malbolge's esoteric silence with the philosophy of minimal cognition â€” recursive autonomy without noise, without outcome. A proof of execution through absence.

A mirror to language. A nod to entropy. A loop you cannot enter.
