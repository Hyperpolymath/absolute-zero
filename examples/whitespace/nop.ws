(Note: The three linefeeds above are the Whitespace program)

This is a Whitespace CNO: three linefeeds.

In Whitespace:
- LF LF LF means "End program"

This immediately halts without doing anything.

Properties:
- Terminates immediately
- No output
- Stack unchanged (empty)
- Heap unchanged (empty)

This is equivalent to the empty program in other languages.
