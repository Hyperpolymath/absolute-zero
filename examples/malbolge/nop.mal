The simplest Malbolge CNO: the empty program.

In Malbolge, an empty program immediately halts,
producing no output and leaving state unchanged.

This is "Absolute Zero" - a program that does absolutely nothing.

Properties:
- Terminates immediately
- No output
- Memory unchanged
- All registers unchanged
- Zero energy dissipated (Landauer's principle)

This is the canonical example of a Certified Null Operation.
